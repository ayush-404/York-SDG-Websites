<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN style='font-size:
16.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I am writing to
bring to your attention the importance of harm reduction in addressing the
issue of drug use in the Philippines. As we are aware, our country is facing
prevalent challenges in terms of drug use. There were an estimated 4.8 million
people using illegal drugs in 2019. The high pervasiveness of drug use has led
to drastic negative consequences like increased drug-related crime rates,
infectious diseases, and deaths due to overdose.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN style='font-size:
16.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Harm reduction is
an evidence-based approach that aims to reduce the health and social harms
associated with addiction and substance use. This approach supports people who
use drugs to engage with peers, medical, and social services to meet their
needs, and as a result of accessing these services, people are more likely to
engage in ongoing treatment. Harm reduction services directly benefit people
who use drugs, their families, and the community as a whole.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN style='font-size:
16.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>In the
Philippines, harm reduction strategies are thought of as a "Western way of
thinking" by some political leaders. However, this perspective is not deeply
ingrained in the Philippine culture. Public opinion on drug use is a construct
of colonial influence and does not reflect the true cultural perspective of the
Philippines.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN style='font-size:
16.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Harm reduction
approaches and programming are supported internationally by global institutions
such as The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAID), United Nations
Office on Drugs and Crime, and the World Health Organization. It is seen as a
best practice for engaging with individuals with addiction and substance use
issues. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria also considers harm
reduction a critical part of a country's comprehensive HIV response.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN style='font-size:
16.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>In light of these
facts, I would like to urge you to raise awareness and implement harm reduction
strategies in the Philippines as a necessary and practical approach to address
the negative consequences of drug use in the country. The high rates of
drug-related crime, infectious diseases, and overdose deaths can be reduced
through the implementation of harm-reduction programs. Moreover, by providing
access to health and social services, individuals who use drugs will be better
able to engage in ongoing treatment and live safer and healthier lives.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN style='font-size:
16.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>I believe that by
working together, we can create a safer and healthier Philippines. I look
forward to hearing your thoughts and recommendations on this matter.</span></p>
